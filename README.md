# Statistical-Methods-(Time-Series)

In this study, using the valuable dataset from the Mauna Loa Observatory, we aim to illustrate how atmospheric CO2 has changed in Hawaii over the period spanning March 1958 to December 2001. 
With the help of modern smoothing methods, our goal is to predict air pollution in Hawaii more accurately. 
Additionally, we have employed the ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model) and SARIMA (Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model) techniques to enhance our predictions.
